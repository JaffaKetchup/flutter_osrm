# flutter_osrm - Early Alpha

**This library is now under construction (as of June 2023), estimated to finish by the start of September 2023. Expect completely broken functionality, even on the 'main' branch.**

See the rough plans over at <https://github.com/users/JaffaKetchup/projects/1>, but that's only a rough estimate!

A wrapper for the Open Source Routing Machine designed for Flutter including optional extra functionality for flutter_map.
