# flutter_osrm - Experimental Alpha

A wrapper for the Open Source Routing Machine designed for Flutter including optional extra functionality for flutter_map

This library is still highly experimental, and therefore documentation (except in-code documentation) and examples are not provided. There is no due date, as I am quite busy at the moment, but you should be able to use the functionality now using a GitHub install/import. Some of the experimental functionality is partially stable, such as the trip API, but I cannot guarantee bug-free code for any of my code, even non-experimental. At the moment there is no integration with `flutter_map`, but it shouldn't be hard to do yourself, just use the returned nodes in a `Polyline`. Use at your own risk.
